Learn from paper WerlingOptimalTrajectoryGenerationforDynamicStreetScenariosinaFrenetFrame
Source from https://github.com/fjp/frenet, fix some issue

Planning the lane changing trajectory by combine the lateral and longitudinal cost function in frenet frame 
Simulated with the control algorithm to avoid collision from moving and static obstacles
